<h5 class="pt-3">About</h5>

<p>
  Hi, my name is Brian Morgan, and this is a labor of love. In an alternate universe
  I am a professional astronomer. Absent that, I pursue my passion with
  <a href="https://astrotuna.com/my-gear/" target="_blank">my telescope</a>.
  I am a math geek and a software developer by trade. This site is the product of all
  those. I hope you find my work helpful.
