<h5 class="pt-3">About</h5>

<p>
  Hello, my name is Brian Morgan, and this is a labor of love. In an alternate universe
  I am a professional astronomer. In this universe I pursue my passion with
  <a href="https://astrotuna.com/my-gear/" target="_blank">my telescope</a>.
  I am a software developer in the New York City area. <strong>U235 Astrophotography</strong>
  is the latest in a series of what I believe are useful tools for astronomy enthusiasts.
  Here is a list of my most memorable:
</p>

<h5>Space-Time Pioneer</h5>

  <p>
    This dates back to 2008.
    Space-Time Pioneer is an electronic clock that displays the position of the Sun, Moon,
    and naked-eye planets Mercury through Saturn. Wake-up alarms can be set on any rise/set
    event as well as a specific time like a conventional clock.
  </p>
  <p>
    Space-Time Pioneer is a gadget comprised of software and hardware that I designed. It
    is based on the Microchip Technology PIC18F2685 microprocessor with 96K bytes of flash
    memory of which I used 99.9%. Due to the vast amount of available information the data
    is displayed in a consistent format. The attached photo shows several such screens:

  <p>
    The top line of the LCD display shows body name, azimuth expressed as points on a compass,
    altitude above horizon, and the name of the constellation it is in.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bottom line shows ancillary information: for the Moon it's phase and percent
    illumination, for all bodies the rise/set times and which direction to face.
  </p>
  <p>
    A special set of screens shows the relationship between the body and the Sun and
    Moon, and how many degrees separate them.

<h5>Hammerharden</h5>

  <p>
    Building on the success of Space-Time Pioneer I wanted a web-based version that was not
    constrained by the limitations of a small LCD panel.
    <a href="https://hammerharden.herokuapp.com/app.html#/viewer/339/0" target="_blank">Hammerharden</a>
    was my first Single Page Application (SPA) written in AngularJS.
    I ported the same computing engine in Space-Time Pioneer from C to JavaScript.

     That link takes you to Central Park, New York City. In the <em>Search Sites</em> input control you
     can type the name of a new site or you can click on the link to <em>Standard Sites</em> to view the
     entire database of sites and visualize with integrated Google Maps. Alternatively you can create
     Custom Sites that will be stored in a cookie.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hammerharden works well in Firefox and Chrome but my apologies to users of Internet Explorer. At the
    time of its writing the version of AngularJS had issues with cookies for that browser. If you use IE
    you will see several warning messages. (Perhaps it is time for me to migrate to a new version of Angular.
    This dates back to 2016.)

<h5 class="pt-3">The Flatinator</h5>

<div class="clearfix">
  <img class="ml-2 mb-2 float-right" src="images/flatinator.jpg" alt="Image: Flatinator" />
  <p>
    Building on my increasing interest in astrophotography I needed a convenient way of capturing a
    type of calibration frame called a <em>Flat</em>. A flat frame is captured by flooding the optical
    path of the telescope with light. Any obstruction like dust or fingerprints on optical surfaces
    will be recorded. Later, during image processing the flat is subtracted from the image of
    the galaxy you took.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days a lot of astrophotographers use electroluminescent (EL) panels but there are other
    solutions. Some people use a tee-shirt and the daytime sky, and others use a computer monitor.
    By far more people are making the transition to EL panels.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first solution used a commercially available EL panel and battery-powered inverter. I
    attached the panel and inverter to a balsa wood board and then inserted two large nylon bolts with
    rubber grommets. The grommets enabled me to cover my telescope's objective lens with the EL
    panel. This worked well but there were two problems: the first is that the batteries, even fresh
    ones, would soon discharge. The second and most important is that it required me to reach up high
    to cover the telescope without disturbing the mount. I was always concerned with losing polar alignment.
    It was even more precarious during winter months with ice and snow on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I really wanted was a solution that I could control remotely from the comfort of my office.
    There are other solutions, most notably a product called <em>Flip-Flap</em>. I researched it but I did
    not like how Flip-Flat was attached to the telescope. It uses a strap which looks quite
    difficult to take on and off when you travel with the scope. I found videos of what other
    people were doing but all used the same strap method. Having video was important to me in that
    it revealed a flaw. The strap does not guarantee that the unit is fixed. It can shift due to
    thermal expansion thereby causing the panel to not close properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    My solution ensures that the unit can be taken on and off with ease as simply as a dust cap,
    and that the EL panel consistently closes tightly. I accomplished this by substituting the
    strap with a 3D-printed frame that holds the entire mechanism and electronics. It can slide
    on and off the telescope's dew shield as easily as a dust cap.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been using the Flatinator for nearly a year with no failures. What's nice is that it
    also acts as a dust cap! When the telescope is indoors I leave the unit on with the flap closed,
    that way the objective lens remains dust free.

  <p>
    I am still debating how to make the Flatinator available. Most people have 3D printers or have
    access to one. It takes about 24 hours for all the parts to be printed. The EL panel and servo
    motor are available through vendors. The few machine nuts and bolts are available at your
    neighborhood hardware store. The only impediment to a complete DIY solution is the electronics.
    The circuit board that I designed is quite small and soldering the surface-mount components are
    beyond the ability of most people.
