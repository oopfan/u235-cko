      <h4>Initial State</h4>
      <p>
        AstroCalc uses terminology familiar to computer programmers. <em>Commands</em>
        tell the computer what action to take (those are the blue buttons.) The
        <em>Accumulator</em> holds the result of the last command. <em>Memory</em>
        remembers the value of the <em>Accumulator</em> whenever you click the <em>Store</em>
        button.
      </p>

        </a>
        <p>
          The <em>Accumulator</em> and <em>Memory</em> are empty in the initial state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only three commands are available from here: <em>Observatory</em>,
          <em>Universal Time</em>, and <em>Coordinates</em>. The remaining commands are unavailable
          because they operate on memory. After you begin storing results those commands will
          become available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Observatory</em>, <em>Universal Time</em>, and <em>Coordinates</em> are always available
          because they simply require raw numbers from you. The other commands operate on the results
          of these. It is a good idea at this time to understand dependencies.

      <h4>Tutorial</h4>
      <p>
        This morning I watched sunrise and wondered what it looked
        like from Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. By the time I
        got to it the Sun was about 25 degrees above my horizon here near
        New York City. My intuition told me that the Sun would be close to
        rising in Arizona but how close I did not know until running
        this calculation.

        <p>
          This is a screenshot of a program called MICA, the <em>Multiyear Interactive
          Computer Almanac</em>, a product from the United States Naval Observatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          From their Introduction: "MICA is a software system created especially for astronomers,
          surveyors, meteorologists, navigators, and others who regularly need accurate
          information on the positions and motions of celestial objects. It provides
          high-precision astronomical data for a variety of astronomical objects."
        </p>
        <p>
          You can purchase it for $29.95 from
          <a href="https://www.willbell.com/almanacs/almanac_mica.htm" target="_blank">
          Willmann-Bell, Inc.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary difference between an <em>Almanac</em> and <em>AstroCalc</em> is
          the way the data is organized. If you ever purchased the <em>Old
          Farmers' Almanac</em> at the checkout of your local grocery store then you
          are familiar with how data is organized. It is in tables. If you are interested
          in the time of sunrise in your town on a particular date then you need to
          <em>interpolate</em> since the almanac is not tailored for you personally.
          Internally, MICA is organized similarly. AstroCalc, on the other hand, uses
          formulas to do its work. I am sure that MICA uses formulas also but it performs
          the heavy computations beforehand whereas AstroCalc performs it on demand.
          AstroCalc is not as precise as MICA but it does not need to for most
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this tutorial, the date is October 14, 2019 and the time is 9:59:07 local
          time on the U.S. east coast, daylight savings time. That is equivalent to
          13:59:07 Universal Time.

      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p>
        Use an Internet search or map service to find the latitude and longitude of Kitt Peak.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <a class="float-left" href="#">
          <img class="mr-2 mb-2 border" src="images/astrocalc-v1-observatory.jpg" alt="Observatory" width="600" />
        </a>
        <p>
          Click the <em>Observatory</em> command button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fill in the form fields and click "OK".
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can see that the result of the <em>Observatory</em> command is placed in the
        <em>Accumulator</em>:
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <a class="float-left" href="#">
          <img class="mr-2 mb-2 border" src="images/astrocalc-v1-observatory-result.jpg" alt="Observatory result" />
        </a>
        <p>
          This is a good time to emphasize that the <em>Accumulator</em> is volatile. It changes after each command
          so it is a good idea to save it to <em>Memory</em> by clicking the <em>Store</em> button. Not only will it
          save your work but it will also make it available to other commands.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Save the <em>Observatory</em> results to memory.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <a class="float-left" href="#">
          <img class="mr-2 mb-2 border" src="images/astrocalc-v1-observatory-store.jpg" alt="Observatory store" width="600" />
        </a>
        <p>
          Click the <em>Store</em> command button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accept the default memory location and then click "OK".
        </p>
        <p>
          Tip: Use the default memory location for all store operations. You will save a lot of time.
          After developing experience with AstroCalc you may develop advanced solutions that may
          benefit from a different name. For now however choose the default.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Here you can see the result of the <em>Store</em> command:
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <a class="float-left" href="#">
          <img class="mr-2 mb-2 border" src="images/astrocalc-v1-observatory-store-result.jpg" alt="Observatory store result" />
        </a>
        <p>
          For now on I will rely on you to store the result of commands. I'll simply show the result.

      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>
        Set <em>Universal Time</em>. The Earth's Prime Meridian is the great arc from North to South pole that passes through Greenwich, England.
        Think of <em>Universal Time</em> as the local time at the Prime Meridian. All calculations begin with it, even the position of the planets
        in their orbits.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <a class="float-left" href="#">
          <img class="mr-2 mb-2 border" src="images/astrocalc-v1-universal-time.jpg" alt="Universal Time" width="600" />
        </a>
        <p>
          Click the <em>Universal Time</em> command button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fill in the fields and click "OK". (If you want to follow this tutorial and achieve
          the same results then you need to use these same values.) After clicking "OK" then click the
          <em>Store</em> button to save the result to <em>Memory</em>. Use the default memory location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tip: AstroCalc pre-populates this form by reading your computer's date and time.
          This is intended to save you time by anticipating that you are interested in where things
          are right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the initial date and time will be different than your computer time if you don't live along
          the Prime Meridian. For example I live in the New York City area. Depending on the season my local time is
          either four or five hours behind <em>Universal Time</em>. Keep this in mind if you want to specify some
          other date and time in your location. You will need to adjust your local time by your time zone's
          <em>Zone Correction</em> in order to derive <em>Universal Time</em>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can see the result:

      <h5>Notes:</h5>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Differences in Sidereal Time are related to formatting.
        Internally, calculations use the full precision as seen in the MICA results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>2</sup> The J2000 coordinates of the Sun are calculated by MICA to high precision.
        For the purpose of this test however I copied the MICA values into AstroCalc by
        using the <em>Coordinates</em> command dialog. By design the dialog limits data
        entry to whole numbers. As you can see the difference is very small but it will
        have an impact on further calculations albeit small.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>3</sup> As expected adjusting the J2000 coordinates for precession introduces
        some error in AstroCalc due to the complex nature of Precession. Looking at these
        numbers the difference is only about 20 arc-seconds which for most applications is
        tolerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>4</sup> The calculations of azimuth and altitude are affected by precession
        as described in the previous step but there is another source of error here:
        Horizontal Parallax. AstroCalc version 1 does not adjust for parallax. It will
        in a future version.
      </p>
      <h5>Final notes:</h5>
      <p>
        * MICA does not adjust for atmospheric refraction which affects altitude
        near the horizon. Neither does AstroCalc but it will in future versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        * In the next version of AstroCalc you will be able to calculate the
        position of the Sun, Moon, and Planets using a new command button.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        MICA is the <em>gold standard</em> as far as I am concerned. As mentioned in the notes
        above, adjusting for Horizontal Parallax will improve the results but there will always
        be some error mostly due to precession. Still I hope you find AstroCalc useful.
